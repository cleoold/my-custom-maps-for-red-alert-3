# my-custom-maps-for-red-alert-3
These maps (mods) work for game *Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3* and *Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3: Uprising*, which are pretty old already. If you don't play the game, this repo is useless.
## instructions on how to use
Each map contain .xml and .map files as a folder. If you have the game installed, go to `users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Red Alert 3\Maps\` (or `Red Alert 3 Uprising`) and copy paste the folder there.  
  
    
      
I leave the maps as my work! Users may edit and redistribute these, but should accredit the owner `cleooldsaty`!
