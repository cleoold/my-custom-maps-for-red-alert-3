This is a super big 3v3 map. On the south of the highway are a great deal of farmlands (pass freely). On the north are a
town with high density of buildings (roads are narrow as some plants are set indestructible). The Oil stations and Ore
points are scattered across and can become the battlefield of participants. The town in the centre is a main point of 
interest. This map is recommended for frontline battling.
The map contains 8000+ props. Due to the area, some positions (eg starting points) lack of beautification and details are
omitted for houses on the edges.


What's in Zone_of_the_Unsupervised:
-The original map with a neutral AI. An advancing player must defeat it first to secure victory. 
(Once the AI displayed in grey loses one of its two oil derricks, it will be granted building options and start hunting.)

What's in Zone_of_the_Unsupervised_DAY:
--The original map with a neutral AI. An advancing player must defeat it first to secure victory. 
(Once the AI displayed in grey loses one of its two oil derricks, it will be granted building options and start hunting.)
Time is set to day. Superweapons of any kinds are also forbidden.

What's in Zone_of_the_Unsupervised_3v3:
-The map without the neutral AI, and with a slight change in starting positions.
-(addition: I like this map)

What's in Zone_of_the_Unsupervised_sightseeing:
-The map used to take screenshots and manga. The map is revealed at the beginning and the player can use three MCVs.
